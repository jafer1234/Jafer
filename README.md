Python Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization 

Below is a vidoe demonstrating the pathfinding visulization tool that leverages the A* pathfinding algorithm, i created this project to demonstrate my ability to write and implement python code. 

The components of the project include the ability to place a starting and ending node, the ability to place walls to demonstrate the algorithms ability to navigate obstacles and the tool also includes the ability to clear and rest the visulization.
